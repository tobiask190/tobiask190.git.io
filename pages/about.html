      The *hiking club* is a club that originates from the Rock church in Anaheim. The club started on ##/##/##. As of now, we go hiking every sunday morning and meet at the rock at 6:00 AM and leave at about 6:15 AM.<br>
      Our attendance as of now is in and out, and we are accepting people from inside and outside of the church. Anyone 18 and above can hike with us. Any minors must be accompanied by their parent in order to accompany us. <br>
      If a ride is necessary, please contact us before every sunday.
